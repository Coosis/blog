      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;before-everything-else&#34;&gt;Before Everything Else:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember how last time I promised to update once I learn more? It turned out that the web design contest has two groups: static, and dynamic. I wanted to try do a dynamic website, and oh boy was it a lot to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;static-and-dynamic&#34;&gt;Static and Dynamic?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;%22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page%22&#34;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, static web page is a web page that is delivered to a web browser exactly as stored, displays the same information for all user, and often stored in a .html file.&#xA;A dynamic website, however, is often a web page generated by a web application. Its contents shift based on user inputs, informations. Dynamic websites are combinations of frontend and backend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;before-everything-else&#34;&gt;Before Everything Else:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;College just started. During one of the tours of the school, I found that there&amp;rsquo;s a Web-Design contest to be held by our school. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t have the first clue of writing html and css and javascript, I still wanted to go and try. There would also be sophomore, junior and senior students participate, but apparently as a freshman I can get bonus score so I would still have a chance. So I started looking into html&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
