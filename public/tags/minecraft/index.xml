      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;before-everything-else&#34;&gt;Before Everything Else:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A week ago, a friend of mine was planning to set up a minecraft server. I got excited, since I have a spare RaspberryPi 4 with 8 gigs of ram ready to be put to use. But with a 32-bit os, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really fit for the job. So I started to use my old laptop. I installed pop!_os, downloaded java 17, and after some research, set up a papermc server. The reason why I chose papermc is that it seems newest, with an out-standing performance and detailed documentation. Now of course, with a server able to run plugins, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to just download everyone else&amp;rsquo;s plugins. I decided to write my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
