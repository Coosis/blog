# Before Everything Else:
Now a college student, I need a way to manage all my classes somehow. Of course, there's the built-in calendar app that can do that, but I think we all know how difficult and frustrating it is to put all classes into the calendar app. I wanted to make my own.

# Swift and Swift UI:
Naturally, apple expects you to build app using Swift and Swift UI. Swift UI is a powerful framework used to build app for ios, watch os, ipad os and mac os, etc. And Swift is the underlying programming language. I rarely see people discuss Swift problems, so I assumed that there's not much I can learn from. And I was right, apart from [apple's own documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift-standard-library), I did not find much to start with. Good thing it is well documented.

# Tools and Resources:
To build apple apps, you need to use Xcode. It's a full-fledged IDE designed especially for this. It handles building, running, debugging and more. I have to admit that I was a bit surprised to see a low rating on AppStore. For learning materials, [apple's resources](https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/) are helpful as they are.

# complaints(Xcode):
After using it for a bit, I must say I feel very uncomfortable. First off, using option+command+{ } to move a line up and down is outrageous. Second, preview is great and all, but why can't I preview a file that has no connection to other files whatsoever(structs, classes, values and more)? To preview, one must get rid of all errors in the entire project. And, if you have "too complex" expressions, you need to break it down so that the editor can make sense out of it and spare you.

# Conclusion:
In the end, I created my own schedule app, and I intend to keep it updated. However due to getting a license for my app is tricky and too much trouble for me, I am going to keep the app on my mac and my phone, as well as [my github repo for it](https://github.com/Coosis/EasyClassSchedule). Maybe when it's truly great I'll actually go through the trouble to do it. But for now this is it.
